#### This app is used to look up Prince George's County Government Offices. The system works by entering the agency of interest and this results in a list being populated with the desired agencies. We also implemented a map feature, this will display the location of each populated agency with the accomanying information in a pop-up banner. If that type of agency does not exist, a list of know PG county agencies will be shown. The Gel All Offices button can be used to get all offices on the map and in the list.
