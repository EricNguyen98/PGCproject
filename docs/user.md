# User Manual

#### Stakeholders: UMD Students

#### This app is used to look up Prince George's County Government Offices. The system works by entering the agency of interest and this results in a list being populated with the desired agencies. This list will display the name of the office, its address, and agency. We also implemented a map feature, this will display the location of each populated agency with the accomanying information in a pop-up banner. If that type of agency does not exist, a list of known PG county agencies will be shown. The Get All Offices button can be used to get all offices on the map and in the list. 

#### Possible agencies include HEALTH,FIRE,PSC,DER,POLICE,SHERIFF,COUNTY EXECUTIVE,DPWT,COURTS,OCS,SOIL CONSERVATION,OHRM, and OIT.
