# Final Report
### Team Members: Eric Nguyen, Heather Sulier, Mahrshi Bakshi, Dyan Bipat, Aranya Prum 
#### Application Link: https://pgcgovofficesfinalproject.herokuapp.com/ 
#### Information Problem: Going into college, and even throughout, many University of Maryland undergraduates are unaware of the government resources that are available to them not only from the University, but from Prince George’s County as a whole.
#### Stakeholders: UMD Students
#### Dataset: Prince George's County Government Offices - https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Government/County-Government-Offices/baxv-ntrj
## Chosen Strategies and Solutions
#### As we were building our application, we came to understand that our information problem isn’t easily solved by giving users a bunch of options to filter through. However, we believe that the ability to see all the different types of agencies, health, court, police, and others, is a good start if you have no clue where to begin. Once the users get to see what types of agencies there are, they should have a better idea of what it is they’re looking for. Overall, we hope this has made the searching process significantly easier.
## Technical System Decision Rationale
#### For this project, we used techniques that we learned in class, specifically HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet to create our map, and Heroku to deploy our app. We chose Javascript, HTML, and CSS since they are some of the premier technologies when it comes to front end development. We used  using these languages to display our data and format our website so that users can have an experience that will meet their specific information needs. CSS, especially flexbox, helped us target specific devices and make a responsive webpage that can be desployed on both desktop and mobile.
## How our final systems helps to address the problem
#### For many of us, finding the government resource we need is not an easy task. Oftentimes we don’t even know where to start looking or what to query on Google. This is where our project comes in. With our system, you don’t have to know where to start. Instead of having to come up with your own query/search term, our system will provide you with the information you need. If you can’t find what you’re looking for in the beginning then you can further filter your results until you find what you need.
## Possible Future Directions
#### For our next steps, we still have some aspects of our project that we'd like to clean up. As it is right now, the application does not look very official. We'd like to change our color scheme and formatting to be more contemporary. Lastly, if we had information on which offices were the most frequently visited by UMD students, we’d want to incorporate that as well.
